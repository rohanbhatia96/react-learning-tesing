# Learning Testing In React

## What's this?

I learnt testing in react using these tutorial on YouTube:

- [Testing with Jest: From zero to hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHMIn723hQY)
- [Intro to React Testing [Jest and React Testing Library Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVBCpefQe8)

This is the repository in which I wrote all my tests.

## Types of test I wrote

1. Basic snapshot tests
2. Mock functions
3. Spy tests
4. Render tests (check whether element is rendered correctly)
